#  Guess The Word Game  
_A Flutter-based Hangman-style word guessing game with sound, animations, and responsive design._

---

## Overview  
**Guess The Word** is an interactive and modern word guessing game (similar to Hangman), built using **Flutter**.  
The player tries to guess a hidden word letter by letter before reaching the maximum number of wrong guesses.  

It features a **colorful animated interface**, **sound effects**, and **motivational messages** after each round.  
This project demonstrates strong understanding of **state management**, **animations**, **UI responsiveness**, and **user experience design** in Flutter.

##  Features  
1. Smooth and intuitive **gameplay logic** (guess, win, lose, play again)  
2. **Sound effects** for success and failure (using `audioplayers` package)  
3. **Animated fade transitions** for motivation messages and results  
4. **Responsive layout** for web, tablet, and mobile devices  
5. **Dynamic word generation** using random logic  
6. **Beautiful UI** with gradients, shadows, and consistent styling  
7. Motivational quotes to keep the player engaged  
8. Clean, modular code ‚Äî easily extendable

## Tech Stack
| Technology | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|
| **Flutter (Dart)** | App framework for UI and logic |
| **audioplayers** | To play sound effects (`success.wav`, `fail.wav`) |
| **Material Design 3** | For modern UI elements |
| **AnimationController** | Fade transitions and smooth visual effects |
| **MediaQuery + LayoutBuilder** | For full responsiveness |

## My Original Work  

This project was **personally designed and developed** by **Ekjot Kaur** as part of a Flutter Lab (Test 1B).  
I worked on:

-  Creating the **entire UI layout** and color scheme (gradients, shadows, rounded containers)  
-  Writing all the **game logic** (win/lose conditions, wrong guess counting, random word selection)  
-  Integrating **audio feedback** for wins/losses using the `audioplayers` package  
-  Implementing **fade animations** using `AnimationController`  
-  Making the UI **fully responsive** using `MediaQuery` and `LayoutBuilder`  
-  Adding motivational quotes to enhance user engagement  
-  Writing meaningful comments in `main.dart` for clarity and maintainability

## External Resources Referenced  

As a learning student, I reviewed **official and educational Flutter resources** to understand syntax, structure, and best practices.  
I did **not copy** any ready-made projects ‚Äî only referred to small code snippets for guidance.

Here‚Äôs what I used for understanding:
-  [Flutter Official Docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/) ‚Äî Widget usage, layouts, animations  
-  [Audioplayers Plugin Docs](https://pub.dev/packages/audioplayers) ‚Äî How to add sound files  
-  [Flutter Layout Examples](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/layout) ‚Äî Designing flexible layouts  
-  [Dart Language Tour](https://dart.dev/language) ‚Äî Understanding Dart syntax and collections  

All logic, design, and structure were written **from scratch** by me after learning from these official resources.

**Conclusion**

This project reflects both creativity and technical skill ‚Äî combining UI/UX, state management, and logic design in Flutter.
It helped me deeply understand how Flutter widgets, layouts, and animations interact together.
